RBT - Robots Meta Tag

WHAT IT MEASURES
Document robots meta tag configuration that controls how search engine crawlers index and follow links on the page. The robots meta tag provides page-level instructions to search engine crawlers, complementing or overriding robots.txt directives.

The robots meta tag can specify:
- Whether to index the page content
- Whether to follow links on the page
- Snippet and preview behavior
- Image indexing permissions
- Caching directives

Common robot directives:
- index/noindex: Allow or prevent indexing
- follow/nofollow: Follow or don't follow links
- noarchive: Prevent cached copies
- nosnippet: Prevent snippets in search results
- noimageindex: Prevent image indexing
- max-snippet: Control snippet length
- max-image-preview: Control image preview size

HOW IT'S MEASURED
DOM analysis checking for robots meta tags and their content. The measurement process:

1. Queries for robots meta elements:
   - Checks for <meta name="robots" content="...">
   - May check for <meta name="googlebot" content="...">
   - Looks for other bot-specific meta tags

2. Validates content attribute:
   - Checks if content directives exist
   - Parses directives (index, noindex, follow, nofollow, etc.)
   - May validate directive combinations

3. Returns configuration:
   - May return boolean (true if properly configured)
   - May return parsed directive values
   - Identifies potential issues (conflicting directives)

The measurement uses:
- document.querySelector('meta[name="robots"]')
- Parses content attribute for directives
- Checks for proper configuration

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
The robots meta tag provides precise control over how individual pages are indexed and represented in search results. It's essential for SEO strategy and preventing indexing of inappropriate content.

SEO control:
- Prevents duplicate content indexing
- Controls which pages appear in search results
- Manages link equity flow (nofollow)
- Controls snippet display in SERPs
- Manages image indexing

Common use cases:
- Noindex on thin content (tag pages, filter pages, search results)
- Noindex on private or sensitive pages
- Nofollow on user-generated content
- Noarchive for time-sensitive content
- Nosnippet for copyright-sensitive content

Prevention scenarios:
- Admin/login pages
- Thank you/confirmation pages
- Duplicate content variations
- Paginated pages (sometimes)
- Filtered/sorted product pages
- Search result pages on your site
- Staging/development pages

THRESHOLDS
- Good: true (robots meta tag properly configured when needed)
- Poor: false (missing robots meta tag when it should be present, or misconfigured)

Not all pages need a robots meta tag (default is to allow indexing). The metric checks if configuration is appropriate for the page type.

COMMON PITFALLS
1. Conflicting directives: noindex, index together (last one typically wins)
2. noindex on important pages: Accidentally blocking content you want indexed
3. Blocking entire site: Using noindex site-wide instead of robots.txt
4. nofollow overuse: Preventing link equity flow unnecessarily
5. Missing meta tag: Not using robots meta when it's needed
6. Conflicting with robots.txt: Contradictory rules in robots.txt and meta tag
7. Using both noindex and canonical: Conflicting signals to search engines
8. Case sensitivity issues: Directives should be lowercase
9. Syntax errors: Incorrect directive names or format
10. Bot-specific contradictions: Different directives for different bots causing confusion

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
1. Use robots meta sparingly: Default is to allow indexing; only use when needed
2. Combine directives properly: Use comma-separated list (e.g., "noindex, nofollow")
3. Be specific: Target specific bots if needed (googlebot, bingbot)
4. Audit regularly: Check which pages have robots directives
5. Don't contradict robots.txt: Ensure rules align
6. Test in Search Console: Verify indexing behaves as expected
7. Use proper syntax: Lowercase directives, comma-separated
8. Consider user experience: nosnippet may reduce click-through rate
9. Use X-Robots-Tag header: For non-HTML resources (PDFs, images)
10. Document your strategy: Keep track of which pages use which directives

Robots meta tag syntax:
```html
<!-- Allow indexing and following links (default behavior, usually omitted) -->
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">

<!-- Prevent indexing but allow following links -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">

<!-- Prevent indexing and following links -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">

<!-- Prevent cached copies -->
<meta name="robots" content="noarchive">

<!-- Prevent snippets in search results -->
<meta name="robots" content="nosnippet">

<!-- Multiple directives -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow, noarchive">

<!-- Target specific bot -->
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">

<!-- Advanced directives (Google-specific) -->
<meta name="googlebot" content="max-snippet:50, max-image-preview:standard">
```

When to use specific directives:
- noindex: Duplicate content, thin content, admin pages, private pages
- nofollow: User-generated content, paid links, untrusted links
- noarchive: Time-sensitive content, privacy concerns
- nosnippet: Copyright-sensitive content, competitive information
- noimageindex: Prevent images from appearing in Google Images
- none: Equivalent to noindex, nofollow

TECHNICAL DETAILS
The robots meta tag is processed by search engine crawlers during page crawling and indexing.

HTML structure:
```html
<head>
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
</head>
```

Robots meta tag characteristics:
- Must be in <head> element
- Uses name="robots" attribute (or bot-specific names)
- Directives specified in content attribute
- Multiple directives separated by commas
- Directives are case-insensitive but lowercase is convention

Available directives:
- index: Allow indexing (default)
- noindex: Prevent indexing
- follow: Follow links (default)
- nofollow: Don't follow links
- none: Equivalent to noindex, nofollow
- all: Equivalent to index, follow (default)
- noarchive: Don't show cached link in search results
- nocache: Same as noarchive (older)
- nosnippet: Don't show snippet in search results
- noodp: Don't use ODP description (deprecated)
- noydir: Don't use Yahoo directory description (deprecated)
- noimageindex: Don't index images on this page
- notranslate: Don't offer translation in search results

Google-specific directives:
- max-snippet:[number]: Maximum snippet length in characters
- max-image-preview:[setting]: none, standard, or large
- max-video-preview:[seconds]: Maximum video preview length
- unavailable_after:[date]: Don't show after specific date

Bot-specific meta tags:
```html
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">
<meta name="bingbot" content="noindex">
<meta name="slurp" content="noindex"> <!-- Yahoo -->
```

Accessing robots meta tag:
- JavaScript: document.querySelector('meta[name="robots"]').content
- Can be changed dynamically (but crawlers cache it)

Robots meta tag vs robots.txt:
- robots.txt: Site-wide crawling directives, checked before crawling
- robots meta tag: Page-level indexing directives, checked during crawling
- Both can be used together
- Meta tag can override robots.txt for indexing (but not crawling)

X-Robots-Tag HTTP header:
- Alternative to meta tag, especially for non-HTML resources
- Same directives as meta tag
- Applied via HTTP headers
- Example: X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow

HISTORY
Robots directives have evolved with the web and search engines:

1994: robots.txt specification created by Martijn Koster to provide site-wide crawl control. Early search engines (WebCrawler, Lycos) adopted it.

1996-1997: The robots meta tag was introduced to provide page-level control, complementing robots.txt. Early directives were index/noindex and follow/nofollow.

2000s: Additional directives added (noarchive, nosnippet) as search engines offered more features like cached pages and rich snippets.

2007: nofollow introduced for links (rel="nofollow") to combat comment spam. The concept extended to page-level nofollow directive.

2008-2010: More advanced directives appeared (noimageindex, unavailable_after) as search engines became more sophisticated.

2019: Google introduced granular robots directives (max-snippet, max-image-preview, max-video-preview) to give publishers more control over how content appears in search results.

2019-2020: Google began treating nofollow as a "hint" rather than a directive for ranking purposes, though crawlers still respect page-level nofollow for crawling.

Present: Robots meta tags are a fundamental SEO tool. They're used extensively for managing duplicate content, controlling indexing, and optimizing search appearance. Search Console provides reports on blocked pages and indexing issues related to robots directives.

BROWSER SUPPORT
The robots meta tag is for search engine crawlers, not browsers:

- Browsers parse but don't act on robots meta tags
- Search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) respect robots directives
- All major search engines support robots meta tags
- No browser-specific features required

INDUSTRY STANDARDS
This metric aligns with search engine guidelines:

Search engine specifications:
- Google: Comprehensive robots meta tag documentation
- Bing: Supports same directives as Google
- Originally part of Robots Exclusion Protocol
- Extended by individual search engines

SEO guidelines:
- Google Search Central: Detailed robots documentation
- Robots Exclusion Protocol: Original specification
- Common SEO practice for indexing control

RELATED METRICS
Robots Meta Tag is part of comprehensive SEO measurement. Related metrics include:

- CNU (Canonical URL): Often used together for duplicate content
- DTL (Document Title): Core SEO element
- MD (Meta Description): Core SEO element
- Don't use noindex with canonical (conflicting signals)
- HSE (HTTPS): Affects crawler behavior

MEASUREMENT LIMITATIONS
Robots meta tag measurement limitations:

1. Can't judge appropriateness: Tools can't determine if robots directives are correct for the page
2. Context needed: Requires understanding page purpose and SEO strategy
3. Can't detect contradictions: Need site-wide analysis to find conflicts with robots.txt
4. Search engine behavior: Can't predict exact search engine interpretation
5. Dynamic content: JavaScript may inject robots tags after initial load
6. Can't measure impact: Need Search Console data to see indexing effects
7. Bot-specific variations: Multiple meta tags for different bots complicate analysis

Manual review needed for:
- Verifying robots directives match SEO strategy
- Checking for conflicts with robots.txt
- Ensuring important pages aren't blocked
- Monitoring Search Console for indexing issues
- Testing crawler access
- Auditing site-wide robots directive usage
