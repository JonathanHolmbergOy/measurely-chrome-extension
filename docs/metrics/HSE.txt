HSE - HTTPS Enabled

WHAT IT MEASURES
Whether the site uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encryption for secure data transmission. HTTPS encrypts all data exchanged between the browser and server, protecting user data and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

HTTPS provides:
- Encryption: Data encrypted in transit
- Authentication: Verifies server identity
- Data integrity: Prevents tampering
- Privacy: Protects user data from interception

HTTPS vs HTTP:
- HTTP: Unencrypted, data visible to interceptors
- HTTPS: Encrypted using TLS/SSL, data protected
- Modern browsers mark HTTP sites as "Not Secure"

HOW IT'S MEASURED
Checking window.location.protocol === 'https:' or analyzing navigation timing for secure connections. The measurement process:

1. Checks protocol:
   - Examines window.location.protocol
   - Verifies protocol is 'https:'
   - May check navigation timing for secure connection

2. Validates HTTPS:
   - Confirms TLS/SSL is being used
   - Checks for secure connection indicators
   - Verifies certificate is valid

3. Returns boolean:
   - true: Site uses HTTPS
   - false: Site uses HTTP (insecure)

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
HTTPS encrypts data in transit, prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, required for modern web features, and affects SEO rankings. HTTPS is essential for security, privacy, and modern web functionality.

Security benefits:
- Encrypts all data in transit
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Protects user credentials and personal data
- Prevents data interception
- Ensures data integrity

Modern web features:
- Required for Service Workers
- Required for Geolocation API
- Required for Camera/Microphone access
- Required for Payment Request API
- Many APIs require secure context

SEO impact:
- Google uses HTTPS as ranking signal
- Browsers mark HTTP as "Not Secure"
- Users trust HTTPS sites more
- Better search rankings

THRESHOLDS
- Good: true (HTTPS enabled, secure)
- Poor: false (HTTP only, insecure)

HTTPS is now considered a requirement, not optional. All sites should use HTTPS.

COMMON PITFALLS
1. HTTP instead of HTTPS: Site served over unencrypted HTTP
2. Mixed content: HTTPS page loading HTTP resources
3. Insecure connections: Some resources not using HTTPS
4. Missing SSL certificates: No valid SSL/TLS certificate
5. Expired certificates: SSL certificates that have expired
6. Self-signed certificates: Certificates not trusted by browsers
7. Partial HTTPS: Some pages HTTPS, others HTTP
8. No HTTP to HTTPS redirect: HTTP pages not redirecting to HTTPS

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
1. Enable HTTPS: Configure server to serve content over HTTPS
2. Obtain SSL certificate: Get valid SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt is free)
3. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS: Automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
4. Use HSTS header: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security
5. Ensure all resources use HTTPS: No mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)
6. Update internal links: Use HTTPS URLs in internal links
7. Update external resources: Ensure third-party resources use HTTPS
8. Monitor certificate expiration: Renew certificates before expiration
9. Test HTTPS configuration: Verify HTTPS works correctly
10. Use CDN with HTTPS: Ensure CDN supports and enforces HTTPS


HISTORY
Web security headers and policies have evolved over decades. HTTP security headers like HSTS were introduced in 2012 (RFC 6797), while Content Security Policy (CSP) was first proposed in 2012 and standardized in W3C CSP Level 3. Cross-origin policies (COEP, COOP, CORP) were developed in response to security vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown discovered in 2018. These security measures became industry standards as web applications grew more complex and security threats increased.

INDUSTRY STANDARDS
This metric aligns with W3C web standards and is used by major performance monitoring tools including Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Real User Monitoring (RUM) solutions. Thresholds are based on research into user perception of performance, industry best practices, and data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX).

MEASUREMENT LIMITATIONS
Client-side measurement may be affected by device capabilities, network conditions, browser implementation differences, and user environment. Some measurements require specific browser APIs that may not be available in all environments. Automated testing may produce different results than real user experiences. Measurements are most accurate when performed in production environments with real user data.
