SSLT - SSL/TLS Handshake Time

WHAT IT MEASURES
Average SSL/TLS handshake time for secure HTTPS connections, measured in milliseconds. The SSL/TLS handshake establishes a secure connection between the browser and server, and slow handshakes can significantly delay resource loading.

SSL/TLS handshake phases:
- Client Hello: Client initiates connection
- Server Hello: Server responds with certificate
- Key exchange: Cryptographic keys exchanged
- Cipher negotiation: Encryption method agreed
- Connection established: Secure connection ready

The metric measures:
- Time from secureConnectionStart to connectEnd
- Average handshake time across all secure connections
- Impact on resource loading performance

HOW IT'S MEASURED
PerformanceResourceTiming analysis calculating secureConnectionStart to connectEnd for SSL/TLS handshakes. The measurement process:

1. Gets resource timing:
   - Uses PerformanceResourceTiming API
   - Identifies resources with secure connections
   - Extracts SSL/TLS timing

2. Calculates handshake time:
   - For each secure resource: connectEnd - secureConnectionStart
   - Measures handshake duration
   - Averages across all secure connections

3. Returns handshake time:
   - Average SSL/TLS handshake time in milliseconds
   - May include breakdown by resource

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
SSL/TLS handshake adds overhead to secure connections. Slow handshakes delay secure resource loading and affect overall page performance, especially on first connections.

Performance impact:
- Adds latency to secure connections
- Delays resource loading
- Affects Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Impacts overall page load time
- More noticeable on first connection

User experience:
- Slower page loads
- Delayed content visibility
- Poor perceived performance
- Increased wait time

THRESHOLDS
- Good: ≤ 100ms (Fast handshake, minimal overhead)
- Needs Improvement: 100-300ms (Moderate handshake time)
- Poor: ≥ 300ms (Slow handshake, significant delay)

COMMON PITFALLS
1. Slow SSL/TLS handshakes: Handshakes taking too long
2. Inefficient cipher suites: Using slow cipher suites
3. Server configuration issues: Poor SSL/TLS server configuration
4. Long certificate chains: Certificate chains causing delays
5. TLS version: Using older TLS versions (TLS 1.0, 1.1)
6. No session resumption: Missing session resumption

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
1. Optimize SSL/TLS configuration: Configure server for optimal handshake
2. Use modern cipher suites: Use efficient, secure cipher suites
3. Implement TLS 1.3: Use TLS 1.3 for faster handshakes
4. Optimize certificate chains: Minimize certificate chain length
5. Enable session resumption: Use session resumption for faster subsequent connections
6. Use OCSP stapling: Reduce certificate validation time
7. Test handshake performance: Measure and optimize handshake times
8. Monitor SSL/TLS performance: Track handshake times over time


HISTORY
Network timing metrics have been fundamental to web performance since the early days of the web. The Resource Timing API was standardized by W3C in 2012, providing detailed network timing information. DNS, TCP, and SSL timing measurements became standard as HTTPS adoption increased and network optimization became more sophisticated.

BROWSER SUPPORT
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) support performance measurement through the Performance API. The PerformanceObserver API, required for many measurements, is supported in all major browsers released after 2016. Some metrics may have limited support in older browsers or require polyfills. Browser DevTools provide built-in performance measurement capabilities.

INDUSTRY STANDARDS
This metric aligns with W3C web standards and is used by major performance monitoring tools including Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Real User Monitoring (RUM) solutions. Thresholds are based on research into user perception of performance, industry best practices, and data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX).

MEASUREMENT LIMITATIONS
Client-side measurement may be affected by device capabilities, network conditions, browser implementation differences, and user environment. Some measurements require specific browser APIs that may not be available in all environments. Automated testing may produce different results than real user experiences. Measurements are most accurate when performed in production environments with real user data.
