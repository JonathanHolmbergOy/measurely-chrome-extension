DNSL - DNS Lookup Time

WHAT IT MEASURES
Average DNS lookup time across all resources. High DNS times indicate DNS configuration issues.

HOW IT'S MEASURED
PerformanceResourceTiming analysis calculating domainLookupEnd - domainLookupStart for all resources

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
DNS lookup time adds to total load time. Slow DNS resolution delays all resource requests

THRESHOLDS
Good ≤ 20ms, Poor ≥ 100ms

COMMON PITFALLS
Slow DNS resolution, DNS configuration issues, no DNS prefetching, inefficient DNS

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
Use DNS prefetching, optimize DNS configuration, use CDN with fast DNS, implement dns-prefetch links


HISTORY
Network timing metrics have been fundamental to web performance since the early days of the web. The Resource Timing API was standardized by W3C in 2012, providing detailed network timing information. DNS, TCP, and SSL timing measurements became standard as HTTPS adoption increased and network optimization became more sophisticated.

BROWSER SUPPORT
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) support performance measurement through the Performance API. The PerformanceObserver API, required for many measurements, is supported in all major browsers released after 2016. Some metrics may have limited support in older browsers or require polyfills. Browser DevTools provide built-in performance measurement capabilities.

INDUSTRY STANDARDS
This metric aligns with W3C web standards and is used by major performance monitoring tools including Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Real User Monitoring (RUM) solutions. Thresholds are based on research into user perception of performance, industry best practices, and data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX).

MEASUREMENT LIMITATIONS
Client-side measurement may be affected by device capabilities, network conditions, browser implementation differences, and user environment. Some measurements require specific browser APIs that may not be available in all environments. Automated testing may produce different results than real user experiences. Measurements are most accurate when performed in production environments with real user data.
